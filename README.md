# Scrum Story Point Forecast

Our sprint forecast for this sprint is 20 points. We have decided on 20 becuase this is our first sprint and that gives an average of 5 points per person. Since it is our first sprint and the technologies are new we wanted to plan for less incase we ran into any blockers.

# Test Driven Development

Our tests for the navaigation UI were built around the tests in the below link. During development for this feature we created a test and made a new page as we continued to add more and more to make sure the navigation was not broken we would run all the tests at each step.

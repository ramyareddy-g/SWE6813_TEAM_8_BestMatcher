# Scrum Story Point Forecast

Our sprint forecast for this sprint is 20 points. We have decided on 20 because this is our first sprint and that gives an average of 5 points per person. Since it is our first sprint and the technologies are new we wanted to plan for less incase we ran into any blockers.

# Test Driven Development

Our tests for the navaigation UI were built around the tests in the below link. During development for this feature we created a test and made a new page as we continued to add more and more to make sure the navigation was not broken we would run all the tests at each step.

<h1>SPRINT 2</h1>

<h2>Sprint 2 Forecast and Rationale</h2>

Our team forecasted that we could complete 23 story points this sprint. That is almost 6 points per person and is a conservative number incase we run into blockers. If this sprint goes well, we will add more to the next sprint or pull in stretch goals this sprint.

<h1>SPRINT 3</h1>

<h2>Sprint 2 Forecast and Rationale</h2>

Our forecast was 31 points for this sprint. Since it was the last sprint, we needed to finish up some additional goals for our project and now that the team was more familiar with the tech stack we thought that we could take on additional points and finish intime.
